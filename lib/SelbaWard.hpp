    This library is a reimplementation of the Selba Ward library created by Hapaxia

    Selba Ward (https://github.com/Hapaxia/SelbaWard)
    Copyright(c) 2015-2022 M.J.Silk

    It exists here solely for the personal use of Zavier Boyles because he didn't
    know how to fix the errors he was recieving. Additionally, it has been reduced
    to only provide the functionality required for the "Burst" project.
    
    Full credit goes to the original creator of Selba Ward.
